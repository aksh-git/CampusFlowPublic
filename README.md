### FOR TEACHERS

* Tecaher's can upload the **notes** just once and after that any student from the respective department and semester can access it at any moment, so teachers don't have to send it to everyone again and again.
* Tecaher's will have to update the **attendence** of students every week (can change update period to 15days) by uploading the excel sheet via the web-app of the **CampusFlow** System after logging by their credentials. `(rolling out, currently in beta)`
* Teachers can make mass and more personalized **announcements** more effectively than before, because this system allows teachers to reach them directly to students chat via one of the most popular messenging app 'whatsapp'.
	
	usage example :
	- using this feature to give assignments and homeworks.
	- make alerts and notices, regarding fee, fines, etc.
